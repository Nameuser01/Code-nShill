# Code-nShill
Personnal web site (hosted on your personnal network)

features:
1 - You can run this web site while you're coding, you have all the YouTube videos that you want at the same place. You also can embed other videos / services as spotify playlists etc...
Interesting point: There is no adds on the videos that you add to your bdd. Can be useful on smartphone, where you can't use an add blocker on YouTube app

2 - You have a little forum. It allow you to plan things, wrote things about the dev or your mind set. Use it as you want.


Installation guide:

1 - Firstly you need to setup a server, as Xampp for instance, in order to host your site.
(Everything is explained here http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/xampp (It's the same for Windows OS, and Mac I guess))

2 - Download the files of code-nShill project.
On linux, do{
  $ sudo rm -rfv /opt/lammp/htdocs/*
Then copy-paste the files of my project in the directory: /opt/lammp/htdocs/
  $ sudo lampp start //If you have done the configuration as doc.ubuntu-fr.org it should work.
Launch your browser and search "http://localhost" you will be able to see the index.php page of this project.
}
On Windows, do{
Go on the xampp installation folder and look for the folder named "htdocs" It's the emplacement of your website (by default)
Erase all the files and folders inside, then copy-paste the files of this project inside the htdocs folder.
Launch your browser and search "http://localhost" you will be able to see the index.php page of this project.
}
On Mac os, do{
I don't use this OS, but it should be the same thing as Linux distributions, or Microsoft Windows OS.
